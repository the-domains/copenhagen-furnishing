# Villa in Trørød

At Copenhagen Furnishing we love to talk to our customers. A central aspect of our work is to create space for people, and that is why we need to know how they think, what they want, and why they do what they do. We are deeply dependable on ideas and feedback from our various customers and and partners, and that is how it must be.

This Villa in Trørød is an excellent example of working with a customer and our partner in interior decoration to create a balance of functionality, aesthetic originality and personal expression. The project clearly benefitted from excellent teamwork.

A specific focus was the balancing of light and shadow, and the core functionality and accessibility of the rooms. We supplied the furniture, handmade materials and craftsmanship for a tasteful and balanced solution of the entire home. We worked hard to secure a perfect finish, and our expertise in mounting, customized solutions and practical design brought the ideas of the customer to life.
