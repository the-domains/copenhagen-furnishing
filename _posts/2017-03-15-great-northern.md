Inaugurated in July 2017, The Great Northern boasts a challenging 18-hole course by Niklaus design, a 9-hole training course, 15 private lodgings accommodating overnight guests, as well as the impressive club house hosting the exquisite Restaurant EAT.

"We strive for greatness in every imaginable detail - from the challenge on each hole, the quality of building materials, the restaurant's raw materials and pro-shop's accessories, the overall level of service you experience at the Great Northern."

We are proud to say that Copenhagen Furnishing did the furniture and decoration of the changing rooms and bathrooms, and worked hard to find a simple and beautiful solution of extremely high quality for this unique place.

With a strict focus on functionality and aesthetic originality, we came up with a discrete combination of colours and materials that help provide a welcoming environment for the many guests of the facility.

It was important to us that our design reflects the unique location the Great Northern, while leaving room for personality and innovation in a warm and graceful atmosphere. The goal was to serve the many purposes of the facility in a relaxed and elegant way, and we are proud to say that we succeeded.
