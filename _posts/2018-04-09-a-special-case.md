# A special case

With some customers, we work on nearly everything. This allows for a more holistic approach, where our practical knowledge and skill is applied broadly in the entire home, and we collaborate closely with the customer and our partner in interior decorating.

"The very special thing about Copenhagen Furnishing is the skill and thoroughness with which everything is carried out, and the fact that Niels always finishes the job to suit our needs as a family. I am constantly amazed by his knowledge, and for many years he has been a huge help to us. Apart from knowing how specific products can serve our needs, Niels is a very decent and honest man, who always keeps a promise, and delivers everything he can and more."

For this exclusive home in .... , we worked on drapes, shelves, furniture, bathroom and bedroom, and helped find aesthetic and functional solutions to practical problems all over the home.

"Many years ago I came to know about Copenhagen Furnishing through our interior designer, and for many years this has been the team we want for the projects in our home. A few years ago we got a very large dining table specially prepared. We could not find a table that suited our style, and as a consequence of this, Niels designed a table for us, and made sure that this was made by a carpenter, to suit our needs. We are so happy to say, we got exactly the dining table we wanted."

"Our kitchen is another thing that Copenhagen Furnishing has put together especially for us, and it is "state of the art". Every day, I send Niel's warm thoughts because of this amazing work. For this he found a special hood at Berbel, which is just really beautiful, and works perfectly for our needs."

A job like this makes it possible to work on very specific details, in order to add a finishing touch, and here the collaborative effort with our colleague in interior design and the customer is very important. It is a true joy to work on a project like this, because the we really get to be creative, and work on solutions that are both innovative and challenging.

"Generally, I can't recommend Copenhagen Furnishing enough. Niels' integrity and professional skill is truly unique (he remembers everything!), and his knowledge of products and ability to always deliver and follow up makes me want to work with him again and again."

"On the more personal side, I admire his honesty and values, and he is easily the most service minded person I have ever met (which says a lot). Niels is a very loyal and decent man, who will go the distance for his customers, and does not leave until the customer is completely satisfied."
