## The elements of life

Bathing has been a central ritual in human life for thousands of years.   
Historically, bathing has often been a collective activity, which took place in public baths, and in some countries the shared social aspect of cleansing the body is still holds great cultural significance. We understand the challenge of balancing the public and private aspects of modern life, and the need for the modern bathroom to be more private in nature. We want to respect tradition, while bringing the past into the future.

To us, the bathroom is unique opportunity to play with materials, textures and colours. The right combination of water, steel, wood, glass and stone can create beautiful atmosphere, and a truly original expression of personality and sense of aesthetics.
