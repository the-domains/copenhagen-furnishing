# Wardrobe

Copenhagen Furnishing are specialists when it comes to the Porro wardrobe. We modify and build cabinets, drawers and walk-in closets to suit any room or customer.

## The fabric of light

In many modern homes, the wardrobe is something to be kept out of sight.   
Although our clothes and the way we put them on has great significance in our lives, the 'life' of the clothes themselves is almost always hidden. Copenhagen Furnishing wants to change this. For us, the primary function of the wardrobe is to represent the clothes in the best possible way. Working with space and light, we aim to make the fabrics come to life, and make anybody want to wear them.   
After all, that is what they are for.

## The Porro wardrobe

Porro has reintroduced the wardrobe as an important part of the modern home. In our mind, what sets Porro apart, is their ability to create a relaxed and yet sophisticated atmosphere in their wardrobe design.

The simple beauty of the Porro wardrobes comes from the tasteful use of light and contrast to enhance and enrich the colours and textures of the clothes, and the simplistic designs that leave enough space for the fabrics to breathe, and room for individualization and original combinations.
