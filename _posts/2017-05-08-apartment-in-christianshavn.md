# Apartment in Christianshavn

We developed a solution for the whole of this apartment in the charming, historical area of Christianshavn, and made an effort to build something special for this very detail oriented customer.

The greatest challenge was creating a new, original design for the kitchen. We worked with the distribution and balancing of colours and surfaces, and integrating simple functionality with the extensive glass walls and the general geometry of the room.

We created an L-shaped dining space to complement the lines of the cupboards and drawers, and made sure that work- and storage spaces was as useful and practical as possible.

The cooking area and extractor hood of this kitchen is something that we are immensely proud of. Using the best possible materials, we worked closely with different partners and our trusted team of technicians to create a one of a kind solution. The idea was to create a simple and yet technically advanced design to fit the atmosphere of this very modern kitchen. And to show that it could be done.
