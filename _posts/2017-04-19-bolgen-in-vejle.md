A central aspect of our work is to create aesthetic continuity and a feeling of unity within the different spaces and functions of a home. Every project must be able to stand for itself, and resonate as a meaningful whole, reflecting the personality and ideas of the customer.

For this very special penthouse in Bølgen, this was exactly what was needed. We worked on everything from lighting, floors, wardrobe, cupboards, shelves and furniture, and created special hanging modules for the slant walls and quirky corners of the apartment. A very special challenge indeed.

We made sure to integrate the different functions and levels of the apartment, with a focus on balancing light and shadow, and drawing in the amazing view and surroundings of the place.
