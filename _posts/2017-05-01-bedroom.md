# Bedroom

Finding a bed, mattress and atmosphere that fits your personal needs is not easy. At Copenhagen Furnishing, we have more than 30 years of experience doing this.

## A quiet place

The concept of _balance_ is central to our work at Copenhagen Furnishing, and as much as we love to create spaces for community and dialogue, we know the value of making room for the individual. The bedroom is an intimate and private place, and this calls for extra attention and care. We work on creating a very personal and relaxed space, with room to breathe and plenty of light _and_ shadow.
